        <h2>Pelosi Found Dead, Murdered By Her Own Party </h2>
        <p>Early this morning, <span class="Trudy"> Trudy Pelosi</span> was found dead in her <span class= "New-York">New York City</span>  apartment.  When the police arrived they discovered the body was bludgeoned to death and a note saying that she had irritated enough Dems that they had had enough of her and finally saw the light regrding socialism.  Police don't have any leads currently but still working on the case.  The chief of police did say this is a terrible situation, but the silver lining is that Dems have finally seen the light and have converted to the right. Yehaw!!!!!
